# ReactiveUI.Primitives

ReactiveUI.Primitives is a small, fast library for reactive programming in .NET. Reactive programming means working
with values that arrive over time, such as button clicks, timer ticks, or network replies, rather than values you
already hold.

If you know LINQ, you already know the shape. LINQ queries a collection you already hold and pulls values out of an
`IEnumerable<T>`. Reactive programming queries values that arrive over time: an `IObservable<T>` pushes each value to
you as it happens. The operators carry over, so `Select`, `Where`, and `Aggregate` keep their meaning here. This library
also gives them the names `Map`, `Keep`, and `Fold`.

It gives you that model without a runtime dependency on System.Reactive, R3, or R3Async. Those are the established
reactive libraries for .NET, and this package stands in for them in the common cases.

It builds on two interfaces that .NET already ships. `IObservable<T>` is a source you subscribe to. `IObserver<T>` is
the subscriber that receives each value. The library renames a few common concepts for clarity. It also favours code
paths that allocate little memory and run under ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. AOT compiles the app to native code
before it runs, so the app cannot generate new code while running.

## Goals and design posture

ReactiveUI.Primitives aims to:

- Cover the Rx model over `IObservable<T>`: creating streams, subscribing, holding state, scheduling work, and
  composing operators. A stream is a sequence of values delivered over time.
- Rename a few concepts where a clearer name helps. A `Signal<T>` is a source you can both push values into and
  subscribe to (Rx calls this a `Subject<T>`). `Map` transforms each value (Rx `Select`); `Keep` filters values
  (Rx `Where`); `Spark` turns each notification into a value you can inspect.
- Stay AOT-friendly. The production package uses no runtime reflection, no generated code, no expression compilation,
  and no hidden dependency on System.Reactive, R3, or R3Async.
- Allocate as little as possible on hot paths. For example, `Signal<T>` subscribes a single delegate directly, and the
  common return, empty, and never sources reuse one shared instance.
- Run in production across modern .NET and .NET Framework, with separate integration packages for Windows UI and other
  platforms. A target framework (TFM) is the .NET version and platform a build targets, such as `net8.0`.
- Support migration. The `.Reactive` package variants match System.Reactive's public surface, and source-generator
  bridges connect to R3 or R3Async when your project already uses them.

## Why not System.Reactive or R3?

System.Reactive is the original Rx library for .NET, and the reason `IObservable<T>` exists. It is mature and widely
used. Its weak point is performance: a typical operator chain allocates several objects per operator and per value, and
that grows under heavy load.

R3 is a newer library aimed at that weak point. It is fast. It reaches that speed partly by replacing `IObservable<T>`
with its own `Observable<T>` type. That swap means existing code, and the wider ecosystem built on `IObservable<T>`,
does not carry over without adaptation.

We wanted the speed without the break, so we kept `IObservable<T>`, the interface .NET already ships and most C# code
already knows. Our benchmarks pointed at the cause: the interface was not the bottleneck. The cost lived in how the
operators were implemented, not in the abstraction. So we kept the familiar contract and rebuilt the operators as
low-allocation sinks (see [Why the operators are built this way](#why-the-operators-are-built-this-way)).

This keeps the change small for anyone already on `IObservable<T>`. You keep the contract and the mental model, and you
gain the lower allocation profile. When you do need full System.Reactive or R3 behaviour, the `.Reactive` package
variants and the R3/R3Async source-generator bridges cover those boundaries.

### Where we could not stay on the standard types

Keeping `IObservable<T>` and `IObserver<T>` was easy, because both ship in .NET itself. Two related types do not, so we
had to make a call.

The first is the scheduler. A scheduler decides when and on which thread work runs. .NET has no scheduler type of its
own. The standard one, `IScheduler`, lives in System.Reactive, so using it would pull System.Reactive back in as a
runtime dependency. That is the dependency we set out to avoid. So the lean library defines its own small scheduling
contract, `ISequencer`.

The second is `Unit`. `Unit` is the type that means "a value carrying no information", used for streams that report that
something happened but carry no data. .NET has no such type either, and the common `Unit` also lives in System.Reactive.
So the lean library defines its own, `RxVoid`.

These two types are the only places the lean surface departs from the System.Reactive shape. The `.Reactive` package
variants close the gap: they recompile the same source with `ISequencer` mapped to `IScheduler` and `RxVoid` mapped to
`System.Reactive.Unit`, so code that already speaks System.Reactive sees the types it expects.

Disposal groups are a third seam, and one the shared types cannot close on their own: `MultipleDisposable` ships in the
dependency-free `ReactiveUI.Disposables` package, so it cannot name `CompositeDisposable`. `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`
adds `ContainerDisposable` for that - a `MultipleDisposable` that converts implicitly to a `CompositeDisposable` it owns
and disposes. Hand one to `DisposeWith`, to a library that takes a `CompositeDisposable`, or to your own helper, and it
just works; anything registered through the composite is disposed with the container.

## Install

All packages are published on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ReactiveUI.Primitives). Install the base
package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives
```

The library is split into a layered set of packages, so you can pull only the surface that matches your
integration point. Every package below is produced by a packable project in the current solution and ships at the same
version. Target frameworks vary by package; the exact matrices are documented under
[Target frameworks and dependencies](#target-frameworks-and-dependencies).

### How the packages layer

The base and async families use type-agnostic `.Core` projects, with a **lean** leaf binding the shared
`RxVoid`/`ISequencer` source to lightweight implementations and a `.Reactive` leaf recompiling it against
System.Reactive's `Unit`/`IScheduler`. Type-agnostic extension-helper sources are compiled into
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Core`, while the lean and System.Reactive helper surfaces ship from `ReactiveUI.Primitives` and
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`. The `src/ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Core` directory is source only; it is not a
project or NuGet package. The platform packages also come in lean and `.Reactive` leaves. (Arrows point from a package
to what it depends on.)

```

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Reactive` are no longer separate projects or
NuGet packages. Their implementations now ship from `ReactiveUI.Primitives` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`,
respectively. No API code was removed: the former lean Extensions package already depended on
`ReactiveUI.Primitives`, and the former Reactive Extensions package already depended on
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`. Replace only the package reference; the existing
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions*` namespaces remain unchanged.

Then import the namespaces you need:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Disposables;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Reactive;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Signals;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;
```

The package metadata is configured to include this README in the NuGet package via `PackageReadmeFile=README.md`. The
base package also packs `Skill.md` at the package root and a Codex-ready copy at
`.agents/skills/reactiveui-primitives/SKILL.md`.

R3 and R3Async bridge generation lives in the standalone `ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator` analyzer package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator
```

That generator does not add runtime R3 or R3Async dependencies to ReactiveUI.Primitives. It emits bridge code only when
the consuming compilation already references the relevant external library symbols. System.Reactive interop is provided
by the `.Reactive` package variants rather than by generated System.Reactive bridge methods.

## Agent Skills

The base `ReactiveUI.Primitives` NuGet package includes `Skill.md` at the package root and a Codex-ready copy at
`.agents/skills/reactiveui-primitives/SKILL.md`. It is an agent-oriented guide for choosing the correct
ReactiveUI.Primitives package, using Async, extension helpers, UI sequencers, bridge source generators, and migration from
System.Reactive package variants, R3, or R3Async while assuming the libraries are consumed from NuGet packages.

After package restore, locate the file in the local NuGet package cache:

```powershell
$version = "<version>"
$skill = "$env:USERPROFILE\.nuget\packages\reactiveui.primitives\$version\.agents\skills\reactiveui-primitives\SKILL.md"
```

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
version="<version>"
skill="$HOME/.nuget/packages/reactiveui.primitives/$version/.agents/skills/reactiveui-primitives/SKILL.md"
```

Install or link the packaged `SKILL.md` into the instruction location supported by the agent. `Skill.md` remains at the
package root for agents or tools that expect a singular markdown guide rather than a skill folder.

## Target frameworks and dependencies

Most shared library packages use `$(LibraryTargetFrameworks)` from `src/Directory.Build.props` and currently target:

- `net8.0`
- `net9.0`
- `net10.0`
- `net11.0`
- `net462`
- `net472`
- `net48`
- `net481`

Package TFM groups are:

- `ReactiveUI.Disposables`, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Core`, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Core`,
  `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive`: `$(LibraryTargetFrameworks)`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.ObservableEvents` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator`: `netstandard2.0`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives`: `$(LibraryTargetFrameworks)` plus `net10.0-android`, `net11.0-android`, and Apple platform
  TFMs (`net10.0-ios`, `net11.0-ios`, `net10.0-tvos`, `net11.0-tvos`, `net10.0-macos`, `net11.0-macos`,
  `net10.0-maccatalyst`, `net11.0-maccatalyst`) when building on Windows or macOS.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`: the same matrix as `ReactiveUI.Primitives`, compiled with System.Reactive `Unit` and
  `IScheduler` aliases.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Wpf` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Wpf.Reactive`: `net8.0-windows`, `net9.0-windows`,
  `net10.0-windows`, `net11.0-windows`, `net462`, `net472`, `net48`, `net481`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinForms` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinForms.Reactive`: `net8.0-windows`,
  `net9.0-windows`, `net10.0-windows`, `net11.0-windows`, `net462`, `net472`, `net48`, `net481`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI.Reactive`: `net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0`,
  `net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`, `net11.0-windows10.0.19041.0`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor.Reactive`: `net8.0`, `net9.0`, `net10.0`,
  `net11.0`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia.Reactive`: `net8.0`, `net9.0`, `net10.0`,
  `net11.0`.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui.Reactive`: `net10.0`, `net11.0`.

Runtime package dependencies are intentionally small. The default production packages do not depend on System.Reactive,
R3, R3Async, or the optional R3 bridge generator. `ReactiveUI.Primitives` references `ReactiveUI.Disposables`,
and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Core`. `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Core` contains the type-agnostic implementation used by the
extension-helper surfaces. `ReactiveUI.Disposables` references `System.ValueTuple` only for `net462`.

The `.Reactive` leaf packages intentionally reference `System.Reactive` through `src/Directory.Build.props`. They
recompile the shared Primitives source with `RxVoid` aliased to `System.Reactive.Unit`, `ISequencer` aliased to
`System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler`, and the shared source shifted into `.Reactive` namespaces.

`ReactiveUI.Primitives`, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Core`,
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive` add .NET Framework compatibility/support
packages where required, such as
`System.ValueTuple`, Microsoft.Bcl.TimeProvider, System.Threading.Channels, System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe,
System.ComponentModel.Annotations, System.Buffers, System.Memory, and System.Collections.Immutable. Add the standalone
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator` analyzer package to generate R3/R3Async bridge methods in consuming projects
that already reference those external libraries.

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor.Reactive` reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components`.
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia.Reactive` reference `Avalonia`.
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui.Reactive` reference `Microsoft.Maui.Core` and
Microsoft.Extensions infrastructure packages. `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI.Reactive`
reference `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`. The remaining shared package references are analyzer, SourceLink, versioning,
ILLink,
reference-assembly, or build-time support packages such as Blazor.Common.Analyzers, Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub, MinVer,
Roslynator.Analyzers, SonarAnalyzer.CSharp, StyleSharp.Analyzers, Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks, and
Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies. Benchmark projects may reference System.Reactive,
System.Reactive.Async 6.0.0-alpha.18, R3, and ReactiveUI.Extensions as comparison baselines, but those references are
not
production dependencies.

## Core model

### `Signal<T>`

`Signal<T>` is the basic signal type: a source you can both push values into and subscribe to. It implements
`ISignal<T>`, which combines `IObserver<T>`, `IObservable<T>`, and `IsDisposed`.

Use it when code needs to push values into a stream and let observers subscribe:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var signal = new Signal<int>();

using IDisposable subscription = signal.Subscribe(
    value => Console.WriteLine($"next: {value}"),
    error => Console.WriteLine($"error: {error.Message}"),
    () => Console.WriteLine("completed"));

signal.OnNext(1);
signal.OnNext(2);
signal.OnCompleted();
```

Important behavior:

- `OnNext(T)` sends a value to active subscribers.
- `OnError(Exception)` terminates the signal with an error.
- `OnCompleted()` terminates the signal successfully.
- `Subscribe(...)` returns `IDisposable`; disposing the subscription unsubscribes.
- `HasObservers` and `IsDisposed` expose basic lifecycle state.
- The `Subscribe(Action<T>)` extension uses an optimized direct-action path for `Signal<T>` when possible.

### Observers and witnesses

ReactiveUI.Primitives keeps the standard `IObserver<T>` shape and provides helper observer implementations internally
under the `Core` namespace.

Common user-facing subscription overloads live in `SubscribeExtensions`:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var signal = new Signal<string>();

using var nextOnly = signal.Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine(value));
using var full = signal.Subscribe(
    value => Console.WriteLine(value),
    error => Console.Error.WriteLine(error),
    () => Console.WriteLine("done"));
```

The library uses the term witness for lightweight observer wrappers. You normally use delegates or `IObserver<T>`
directly rather than constructing witness types by hand.

### Using Primitives alongside System.Reactive

Packages such as DynamicData can bring in System.Reactive transitively. Importing both `System` and
`ReactiveUI.Primitives` then exposes two sets of `Subscribe` extension methods for `IObservable<T>`.
Use `SubscribePrimitives` to select the Primitives implementation without changing the observable:

```csharp
using var subscription = saveCommand.ThrownExceptions.SubscribePrimitives(
    error => activity.AddItem(error.ToString()));
```

It has the same five callback overloads and behavior as `Subscribe`, including disposal and unhandled-error
propagation. Existing `Subscribe` APIs remain available. An explicit static call also selects Primitives:

```csharp
using var subscription = SubscribeExtensions.Subscribe(
    saveCommand.ThrownExceptions,
    error => activity.AddItem(error.ToString()));
```

Putting `using ReactiveUI.Primitives;` inside the consuming namespace also gives its extension methods
precedence over a global `using System;`. This applies per namespace; a global import alone does not
resolve the conflict. Import only one set of LINQ operators when their signatures overlap.

`SubscribeSafe` is not a drop-in rename: its single `Action<Exception>` overload handles terminal errors,
not values emitted by an `IObservable<Exception>`. To handle exception values with `SubscribeSafe`, supply
both `onNext` and `onError` explicitly.

System.Reactive declares its own observer-taking `SubscribeSafe` in the `System` namespace, so that one
overload is ambiguous under the same conditions as `Subscribe`. Use `SubscribeSafePrimitives(observer)` to
select the Primitives implementation. The callback shapes of `SubscribeSafe` have no System.Reactive
counterpart and stay callable under their own name.

### Scheduling event handlers and drawing

`ObserveOn` schedules downstream notifications. Moving work from an event handler into a subscriber
after `ObserveOn` therefore changes when that work runs, even when the scheduler targets the UI thread.
For paint events such as SkiaSharp's `PaintSurface`, draw synchronously while the event's surface is valid.
Do not defer use of its canvas through `ObserveOn` or an `await`. Schedule a redraw request instead, and
perform the drawing in the resulting paint callback.

The `Signal.FromEventPattern<TEventHandler, TEventArgs>(conversion, addHandler, removeHandler)` overload
lets a custom event handler perform synchronous work before invoking the notification callback. Each
subscription owns its converted handler and detaches that same handler on disposal. Supplying the conversion
also avoids deriving the handler reflectively, which is what makes this shape trim- and AOT-safe.

Three siblings build on the same conversion. `FromEventPattern<TEventHandler, TSender, TEventArgs>` keeps the
sender's static type instead of erasing it to `object`. `FromEvent<TEventHandler, TEventArgs>` emits the event
argument on its own, for events that carry no sender, and `FromEvent<TEventArgs>(addHandler, removeHandler)`
covers the plain `Action<TEventArgs>` case. Every one of them, and every `FromEventPattern` overload, accepts a
trailing sequencer that attaches and detaches the handler as scheduled work rather than on the subscribing
thread — the shape to use when an event may only be subscribed from the UI thread:

```csharp
using var painted = Signal.FromEventPattern<SKPaintSurfaceEventArgs>(
        handler => view.SkiaElement.PaintSurface += handler,
        handler => view.SkiaElement.PaintSurface -= handler,
        RxSchedulers.MainThreadScheduler)
    .SubscribePrimitives(pattern => Draw(pattern.EventArgs));
```

Disposing cancels a pending attach, so a subscription torn down before the sequencer ran it never leaves the
handler on the event.

`Throttle` (also called `Calm` or `Stabilize`) waits for a quiet period after the most recent value.
By default its timer uses the thread pool; it does not marshal the result to the UI thread. Use
`Throttle(duration, uiSequencer)` or put `ObserveOn(uiSequencer)` after `Throttle` when the subscriber
requires the UI thread. Source completion flushes a pending value immediately, matching Rx debounce
semantics; it does not wait for the remaining quiet period.

### Disposables, handles, and slots

Subscriptions and scheduled work return `IDisposable`. ReactiveUI.Primitives includes lightweight disposable primitives
in `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Disposables`:

| Type                                                       | Use                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Disposable.Create(Action)`                                | Create an `IDisposable` from a cleanup action.                    |
| `Disposable.Empty`                                         | No-op disposable.                                                 |
| `BooleanDisposable`                                        | Track simple disposed state.                                      |
| `CancellationDisposable`                                   | Tie disposal to a `CancellationTokenSource`.                      |
| `MultipleDisposable`                                       | Composite-disposable equivalent; add/remove multiple disposables. |
| `CompositeDisposable`                                      | System.Reactive-compatible alias over `MultipleDisposable`.       |
| `Pocket`                                                   | Named `MultipleDisposable` specialization.                        |
| `SingleDisposable` / `AssignmentSlot`                      | Single-assignment disposable container.                           |
| `SingleReplaceableDisposable` / `Slot`                     | Replaceable disposable container.                                 |
| `Handle`, `Handle<T>`, `Handle<T1,T2>`, `Handle<T1,T2,T3>` | Lightweight handle wrappers for resource lifetimes.               |

Example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Disposables;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var subscriptions = new MultipleDisposable();
var signal = new Signal<int>();

signal.Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine(value)).DisposeWith(subscriptions);
signal.Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine(value * 10)).DisposeWith(subscriptions);

signal.OnNext(3);
subscriptions.Dispose();
```

Example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<int> values = Signal.Sequence(1, 5);

using var subscription = values.Subscribe(
    value => Console.WriteLine(value),
    error => Console.Error.WriteLine(error),
    () => Console.WriteLine("range completed"));
```

Custom source example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Disposables;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<string> source = Signal.CreateSafe<string>(observer =>
{
    observer.OnNext("ready");
    observer.OnCompleted();
    return Disposable.Empty;
});
```

## Operators

Operators are extension methods over `IObservable<T>`. Like a LINQ query over `IEnumerable<T>`, an operator takes a
stream and returns a new stream, so you can chain them into a pipeline. ReactiveUI.Primitives ships its own names
(`Map`, `Keep`, `Fold`, `Blend`, `SwitchTo`, and more). These names avoid call-resolution clashes with System.Reactive
or R3. The familiar System.Reactive and LINQ names also work (see below), so you can write whichever reads best.

### Why the operators are built this way

Each operator is a purpose-built sink, not a wrapper around another observable. A wrapper chain allocates an observable
and an observer for every operator, on every subscription, and each value then hops through the whole stack. A sink does
the operator's work in one object and hands the result straight to the next stage. Fewer objects and fewer hops mean
fewer allocations per value.

That difference matters most under high throughput. Reactive pipelines often run where events never stop and volume is
large: device and sensor telemetry (IoT), market data and payment flows in banking, and log or metric ingestion. At
millions of events per second, per-value allocations create work for the garbage collector, and that work shows up as
pauses. Keeping allocations low gives steadier latency and higher sustained throughput. This is why the library favours
direct subscription and shared singletons, and why the dedicated names bind the compiler straight to these sink-based
operators with no ambiguity against the System.Reactive or LINQ overloads.

### System.Reactive / LINQ name layer

The everyday System.Reactive and LINQ names are first-class operators. Each builds the **same sink** as its
Primitives-named counterpart, with identical behaviour and allocation profile. A sink is the small object that receives
each value and does the operator's work. These names are not wrappers. Both name sets are fully supported and
interchangeable, so pick whichever reads best.

| LINQ / System.Reactive name | Primitives name | | LINQ / System.Reactive name | Primitives name |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| `Select`                    | `Map`           | | `Merge`                     | `Blend`         |
| `SelectWith`                | `MapWith`       | | `Concat`                    | `Chain`         |

| `WhereNotNull`              | `KeepNotNull`   | | `Zip`                       | `Pair`          |
| `Do`                        | `Tap`           | | `CombineLatest`             | `SyncLatest`    |
| `DoWith`                    | `TapWith`       | | `WithLatestFrom`            | `Latch`         |
| `Scan`                      | `Fold`          | | `SelectMany`                | `FlatMap`       |
| `Aggregate`                 | `Reduce`        | | `Delay`                     | `Shift`         |
| `DistinctUntilChanged`      | `Unique`        | | `Timeout`                   | `Expire`        |

| `IgnoreElements`            | `IgnoreValues`  | | `Retry`                     | `Reattempt`     |
| `Materialize`               | `Spark`         | | `Dematerialize`             | `Unspark`       |

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

// Reads exactly like System.Reactive, and builds the identical sinks as Map/Keep/Fold.
using var subscription = Signal.Sequence(1, 10)
    .Where(value => value % 2 == 0)
    .Select(value => value * value)
    .Scan(0, (total, value) => total + value)
    .Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);
```

> Caveat: because these names live in the `ReactiveUI.Primitives` namespace, a file that *also* imports
`System.Reactive.Linq` will get ambiguous-call errors on shared names like `.Select`/`.Where`. Use the Primitives
> names (`Map`/`Keep`) in those mixed files, or migrate the file fully off System.Reactive.

    .Tap(label => Console.WriteLine($"observed {label}"));

using var subscription = labels.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);

Blend example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<int> low = Signal.Sequence(1, 3);
IObservable<int> high = Signal.Sequence(100, 3);

using var merged = Signal.Blend(low, high)
    .Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine(value));
```

SyncLatest example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var width = new StateSignal<int>(640);
var height = new StateSignal<int>(480);

using var area = Signal.SyncLatest(width, height, (w, h) => w * h)
    .Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine($"area={value}"));

width.Value = 800;
height.Value = 600;
```

`SyncLatest` and the System.Reactive-named `CombineLatest` overloads support multi-source projections up to 16 total
sources. The `.Reactive` package variants expose the same overloads with `System.Reactive.Unit` and `IScheduler`
conventions, which keeps migrated Rx code using familiar `CombineLatest` names while running on the Primitives
implementation.

`CombineLatest` also provides tuple results for 2–16 sources without a selector. Tuple members are named
`First`, `Second`, `Third`, and so on, and values start flowing after every source has produced a value:

```csharp
using var dimensions = width.CombineLatest(height)
    .SubscribePrimitives(size => Console.WriteLine($"{size.First} x {size.Second}"));
```

When the sources share an element type and are too many to name, or they only exist as a collection,
`CombineLatest` also combines them into an `IList<T>`, with an optional selector over that list. The
collection is enumerated once, when the operator is called, and every notification carries its own list:

```csharp
using var totals = gauges.CombineLatest(readings => Total(readings))
    .SubscribePrimitives(total => Console.WriteLine($"total={total}"));
```

Listing two to sixteen same-typed sources inline still selects the tuple overload that names each of them;
the list overload takes over past that arity, and whenever the sources arrive as an array or a sequence.

Multi-source latest example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var first = new StateSignal<int>(1);
var second = new StateSignal<int>(2);
var third = new StateSignal<int>(3);

using var total = first
    .SyncLatest(second, third, static (a, b, c) => a + b + c)
    .Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine($"total={value}"));

third.Value = 10;
```

The Rx-name `SelectMany` observable overloads keep concurrent merge semantics. Use `FlatMap` or `Bind` when you want the
Primitives name, and use `SelectMany` when porting existing Rx code or keeping LINQ query syntax.

Fused projection example (`Choose` and `SwitchSelect`):

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

// Choose folds Where + Select into one sink. The explicit HasValue flag lets a
// non-nullable value type be dropped without a nullable wrapper.
using var evens = Signal.Sequence(1, 6)
    .Choose(value => (value % 2 == 0, value * 10))
    .Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine($"even*10={value}"));

// SwitchSelect folds WhereNotNull + Select + Switch: skips null keys, projects each
// to an inner source, and mirrors only the latest inner.
var key = new StateSignal<string?>(null);
using var latest = key
    .SwitchSelect(selectedKey => Signal.Sequence(selectedKey.Length, 3))
    .Subscribe(value => Console.WriteLine($"latest={value}"));

key.Value = "ab";
key.Value = "abcd";
```

Direct static helpers are available when a call site wants an explicit source argument instead of extension-method
syntax:

| `Signal.Expire(source, dueTime)` / `Signal.Expire(source, dueTime, sequencer)`   | Apply the Primitives timeout operator directly to a source.              |
| `Signal.Timeout(source, dueTime)` / `Signal.Timeout(source, dueTime, sequencer)` | System.Reactive-name alias for the direct `Expire` helper.               |
| `Signal.ToTask(source)` / `Signal.ToTask(source, cancellationToken)`             | Await source completion and return the final value, matching `ToTask()`. |
| `Signal.RunAsync(source)` / `Signal.RunAsync(source, cancellationToken)`         | Subscribe immediately and return an awaitable signal for the run.        |

After example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

using var subscription = Signal.After(
        dueTime: TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250),
        period: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
        scheduler: ThreadPoolSequencer.Instance)
    .Take(3)
    .Subscribe(
        tick => Console.WriteLine($"tick {tick}"),
        error => Console.Error.WriteLine(error),
        () => Console.WriteLine("timer completed"));
```

### Spark materialization

`Spark<T>` represents value/error/completion notifications. Use `Spark` to convert stream events into values and
`Unspark` to turn them back into observer notifications.

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;

## ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` is the async counterpart to the base `ReactiveUI.Primitives` surface. Its observers
deliver each notification through a `ValueTask` and accept a `CancellationToken`, so a producer can await the consumer.
Use it when notification, disposal, or stream collection must run asynchronously. It keeps the Primitives vocabulary,
generates the R3 and R3Async bridges, and offers System.Reactive-flavoured `.Reactive` variants.

Core async contracts and data types:

| API                               | Purpose                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IObservableAsync<T>`             | Async observable contract. `SubscribeAsync` receives an `IObserverAsync<T>` and returns an `IAsyncDisposable`.      |
| `IObserverAsync<T>`               | Async observer contract with `OnNextAsync`, `OnErrorResumeAsync`, `OnCompletedAsync`, and inherited `DisposeAsync`. |
| `WitnessAsync<T>`                 | Base observer type for implementing async observers with disposal, cancellation linking, and concurrency checks.    |
| `ISignalAsync<T>`                 | Pushable async signal that combines `IObserverAsync<T>`, `IObservableAsync<T>`, and a `Values` observable.          |
| `SignalAsync<T>`                  | Abstract base and static factory/operator host for async observables.                                               |
| `ConnectableSignalAsync<T>`       | Async connectable sequence returned by multicast/publish operators.                                                 |
| `Result`                          | Completion result that represents success or terminal failure.                                                      |
| `Optional<T>`                     | Allocation-free optional value used by replay/latest async signals.                                                 |
| `AsyncContext`                    | Dispatch abstraction over `SynchronizationContext`, `TaskScheduler`, or `ISequencer`.                               |
| `ConcurrentWitnessCallsException` | Raised when a serial witness detects concurrent observer calls.                                                     |
| `UnhandledExceptionHandler`       | Central handler for async fire-and-forget failures.                                                                 |

Async signal factories live in two places. Use `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Signals.Signal` when you need a mutable
signal, and use `SignalAsync` when you need a sequence factory or operator:

| Factory group       | APIs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Async operators follow the same naming style as the core package where that avoids collisions with System.Reactive/R3,
while preserving familiar aliases for compatibility:

| Category             | APIs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Basic async sequence example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;

List<string> labels = await SignalAsync.Sequence(1, 12)
    .Keep(static value => value % 2 == 0)
    .Map(static value => $"even:{value}")
    .ToListAsync();
```

Mutable async signal example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Signals;

ISignalAsync<int> requests = Signal.Create<int>();

await using IAsyncDisposable subscription = await requests.Values
    .Map(static value => value * 2)
    .SubscribeAsync(value => Console.WriteLine(value));

await requests.OnNextAsync(21, CancellationToken.None);
await requests.OnCompletedAsync(Result.Success);
```

Async context example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;

AsyncContext context = AsyncContext.From(TaskScheduler.Default);

await using IAsyncDisposable subscription = await SignalAsync.Sequence(1, 3)
    .ObserveOn(context)
    .SubscribeAsync(static value => Console.WriteLine(value));
```

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator` also emits async bridge adapters. A consumer that references R3,
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and the generator can use generated
`AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable<T>(this R3.Observable<T>)` and
`AsR3Observable<T>(this IObservableAsync<T>)`; a consumer that references R3Async can use
`AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable<T>(this R3Async.AsyncObservable<T>)` and
`AsR3AsyncObservable<T>(this IObservableAsync<T>)`. System.Reactive-shaped async APIs are handled by
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive`, not by generated System.Reactive.Async adapters.

## Extension helpers

The `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions` namespace migrates the non-async helper surface from `ReactiveUI.Extensions` onto
`ReactiveUI.Primitives`. The lean implementation is based on the BCL `IObservable<T>` contract, uses `ISequencer` for
scheduling, and does not reference System.Reactive, R3, or R3Async. The corresponding
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Reactive` namespace ships from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive` and uses
System.Reactive `Unit` and `IScheduler` conventions.

These namespaces previously shipped from separate `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions` and
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Reactive` packages. Their code has been consolidated into the base lean and Reactive
packages; no helper implementation or public namespace was removed.

Core utility surface:

| `Stale<T>` / `IStale<T>`           | Value plus stale/fresh state from stale-detection operators.                                                                                             |
| `Continuation`                     | Disposable continuation helper for bridging synchronous waits.                                                                                           |
| `Observables.Return<T>(value)`     | Single-value observable factory.                                                                                                                         |
| `ObserverExtensions.FastForEach`   | Pushes enumerable values into an observer with array/list fast paths.                                                                                    |
| `ObservableSubscriptionExtensions` | Synchronous test/utility helpers: `SubscribeGetValue`, `SubscribeAndComplete`, `SubscribeGetError`, `WaitForValue`, `WaitForCompletion`, `WaitForError`. |

Filtering and projection example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<string> labels = Signal.Sequence(1, 10)
    .WhereSelect(
        static value => value % 2 == 0,
        static value => $"even:{value}");

using IDisposable subscription = labels.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);
```

Scheduling example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions;

ISequencer sequencer = ThreadPoolSequencer.Instance;

using IDisposable work = "ready"
    .Schedule(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50), sequencer)
    .Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);
```

Async selector example over a BCL observable:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<string> names = Signal.Sequence(1, 3)
    .SelectAsyncSequential(static async value =>
    {
        await Task.Yield();
        return $"item:{value}";
    });

using IDisposable subscription = names.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);
```

These helpers are intended for applications that already use the operators from `ReactiveUI.Extensions` and want the
same shapes without pulling System.Reactive or R3 into the lean production dependency graph.
`Filter(string pattern)` creates a regex with a 30-second match timeout so ordinary filters remain stable under
instrumented CI runs while still protecting against runaway patterns. Use `Filter(Regex regex)` when a caller-specified
regex timeout or options set must be preserved exactly.

## Stateful signals and subject-like types

ReactiveUI.Primitives uses explicit names instead of cloning every System.Reactive subject type name.

| System.Reactive type                             | ReactiveUI.Primitives equivalent         | Notes                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Subject<T>`                                     | `Signal<T>`                              | Push values, errors, and completion to subscribers.                                                                                                     |
| `BehaviorSubject<T>`                             | `StateSignal<T>`                         | Stores the latest value, exposes a mutable `Value`, and emits changes through `Changed`.                                                                |
| `ReplaySubject<T>`                               | `ReplaySignal<T>`                        | Replays buffered values by size and/or time window.                                                                                                     |
| `AsyncSubject<T>`                                | `FinalSignal<T>`                         | Awaitable subject-like signal; also implements `IAwaitSignal<T>`.                                                                                       |
| `ReactiveProperty<T>` / state holder             | `StateSignal<T>` plus `ReadOnlyState<T>` | Mutable state and read-only projected state.                                                                                                            |
| `Subject<T>.ObserveOn(scheduler)`                | `ScheduledSignal<T>`                     | Multicast signal that dispatches its notifications on an `ISequencer`, with an optional default observer active while no other subscribers are present. |
| `Buffer(boundary).SelectMany(distinct)` pipeline | `DelayableNotificationSignal<T>`         | Passes notifications through immediately while not delayed, buffers them while delayed, and emits a de-duplicated batch on `Flush`.                     |

State example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var temperature = new StateSignal<double>(21.5);
ReadOnlyState<string> status = temperature.ToReadOnlyState(value =>
    value >= 25.0 ? "warm" : "normal");

using var stateSubscription = status.Changed.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);

temperature.Value = 26.2;
temperature.Refresh();
```

Replay example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var history = new ReplaySignal<string>(bufferSize: 2);
history.OnNext("A");
history.OnNext("B");
history.OnNext("C");

using var subscription = history.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine); // replays B, C
```

Delayable example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

var delayed = true;
var notifications = Signal.Delayable<string>(() => delayed, items => items.Distinct());

using var subscription = notifications.Subscribe(Console.WriteLine);

notifications.OnNext("A");
notifications.OnNext("A"); // buffered while delayed
delayed = false;
notifications.Flush();     // emits the de-duplicated batch: A
```

Error and completion example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

IObservable<int> failed = Signal.Fail<int>(new InvalidOperationException("not available"));

using var subscription = failed.Subscribe(
    value => Console.WriteLine(value),
    error => Console.WriteLine($"failed: {error.Message}"),
    () => Console.WriteLine("completed"));
```

## Sequencers

A sequencer decides when and on which thread scheduled work runs. Rx calls this a scheduler. Sequencers live in
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency` and implement `ISequencer`. The core `ReactiveUI.Primitives` package does not
reference WPF, Windows Forms, WinUI, Blazor, Avalonia, or MAUI. The optional integration packages supply the UI-thread
sequencers.

| Sequencer                                                     | Purpose                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Sequencer.Immediate` / `ImmediateSequencer.Instance`         | Execute work immediately.                                                              |
| `Sequencer.CurrentThread` / `CurrentThreadSequencer.Instance` | Queue recursive/current-thread work deterministically.                                 |
| `ThreadPoolSequencer.Instance`                                | Schedule work through the thread pool.                                                 |
| `TaskPoolSequencer.Instance`                                  | Schedule work through tasks.                                                           |
| `SynchronizationContextSequencer`                             | Schedule through a `SynchronizationContext`.                                           |
| `DispatcherSequencer`                                         | Schedule onto a WPF dispatcher from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Wpf`.                       |
| `ControlSequencer`                                            | Schedule onto a Windows Forms control from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinForms`.           |
| `DispatcherQueueSequencer`                                    | Schedule onto a WinUI dispatcher queue from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI`.             |
| `BlazorRendererSequencer`                                     | Schedule component work through Blazor's renderer from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor`. |
| `AvaloniaScheduler`                                           | Schedule onto an Avalonia dispatcher from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia`.             |
| `MauiDispatcherSequencer`                                     | Schedule onto an MAUI dispatcher from `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui`.                    |
| `VirtualClock`                                                | Virtual-time scheduling for deterministic tests.                                       |

WPF, Windows Forms, WinUI, Blazor, and MAUI sequencers derive from `DispatchSequencerBase`. That shared base batches
ready work into a single posted dispatcher drain, preserves FIFO order, skips cancelled work lazily, and routes delayed
UI work through the shared `ThreadPoolSequencer` timing queue before marshaling back to the UI thread. Platform packages
only provide the final dispatcher-specific post primitive. `AvaloniaScheduler` provides the same coalesced dispatcher
drain behavior and uses dispatcher-bound timers for delayed work, so both posted and delayed callbacks stay associated
with the selected Avalonia dispatcher and priority.

`AvaloniaScheduler.Instance` uses `Dispatcher.UIThread` at `DispatcherPriority.Background`. To bind scheduling to a
specific dispatcher or priority, construct `new AvaloniaScheduler(dispatcher)` or
`new AvaloniaScheduler(dispatcher, priority)`. The lean type is
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency.AvaloniaScheduler`; the System.Reactive-compatible type is
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive.Concurrency.AvaloniaScheduler` from
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia.Reactive`.

Scheduling APIs include absolute, relative, recursive, and action-based overloads:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency;

IDisposable scheduled = ThreadPoolSequencer.Instance.Schedule(
    TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100),
    () => Console.WriteLine("scheduled work"));

scheduled.Dispose();
```

For hot convenience-call paths, prefer the stateful overload with a static callback to avoid closure capture:

```csharp
sequencer.Schedule(observer, static target => target.OnCompleted());
```

Use virtual clocks for deterministic time-sensitive tests rather than sleeping a real thread.

## Threading, disposal, and error semantics

ReactiveUI.Primitives follows the BCL observer contract and keeps ownership explicit:

- `OnNext` is delivered synchronously on the thread that invokes it unless an operator or sequencer explicitly schedules
  work elsewhere.
- Time-based factories and operators use `ISequencer` overloads where deterministic or UI-thread dispatch matters. Use
  `VirtualClock` for tests; avoid sleeping real threads.
- A subscription is an `IDisposable`. Disposing a subscription removes that observer and prevents later notifications to
  that subscription. Disposing a composite (`MultipleDisposable`, `Pocket`, `Slot`, etc.) cascades to contained
  disposables according to the container contract.
- Terminal notifications are single-assignment: `OnCompleted` and `OnError` end a signal, and later values are ignored
  by terminated sources.
- `OnError(Exception)` requires a non-null exception and propagates the terminal error to current subscribers. Operators
  such as `Recover`, `Rescue`, `Resume`, `Reattempt`, and `Signal.Recover` are the explicit recovery points.
- Observer callback exceptions are guarded by the operator/source that owns the callback. Prefer `CreateSafe` for custom
  sources unless you are deliberately implementing lower-level observer semantics.
- The default lean packages have no runtime dependency on System.Reactive, R3, or R3Async. The `.Reactive` variants
  intentionally reference System.Reactive, and bridge generators only emit R3/R3Async boundary adapters when a consuming
  project already references those packages.

## Observable-event source generation

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.ObservableEvents` is a standalone incremental source-generator package. It has no runtime
dependency on a particular observable implementation; it inspects the consuming compilation and emits adapters for
the first compatible provider it finds:

- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals.Signal` and `RxVoid` for lean Primitives projects.
- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive.Signals.Signal` and `System.Reactive.Unit` for `.Reactive` projects.
- `System.Reactive.Linq.Observable` and `System.Reactive.Unit` for standalone System.Reactive projects that do not
  reference any ReactiveUI.Primitives package.

Install it alongside the observable provider already used by the application:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.ObservableEvents
```

Instance generation is activated by calling `Events()` once for an event host. The generator replaces the marker
result with a strongly typed wrapper whose properties subscribe and unsubscribe from the corresponding public events:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.ObservableEvents;

IObservable<EventArgs> changes = viewModel.Events().Changed;
```

Request public static events with an assembly attribute. Static observable properties are generated on `RxEvents` in
the event host's namespace. Their names use length-prefixed host and event identifiers so type, nesting, and event-name
boundaries cannot collide:

```csharp
[assembly: ReactiveUI.Primitives.ObservableEvents.GenerateStaticEventObservables(typeof(AppEvents))]

IObservable<string> messages = RxEvents.T9AppEvents7Message;
```

Delegate payloads use `RxVoid` or `Unit` for no parameters, the sole parameter for one parameter, the event-args
parameter for conventional `(object sender, TEventArgs args)` events, and a named tuple for other multi-parameter
delegates. Delegates returning `void`, `Task`, or `ValueTask` are supported. Unsupported signatures produce `RXOE003`;
missing providers and empty requests produce `RXOE001` and `RXOE002` respectively.

## Source-generator bridge behavior

A source generator is a compiler component that writes extra C# code into your project at build time. R3 and R3Async
bridge generation is opt-in through the standalone analyzer package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator
```

The package ships one analyzer assembly:

- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator.dll`

The generator is no longer embedded in `ReactiveUI.Primitives` or `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and those runtime
packages do not depend on it. Add the generator package only to projects that need generated R3 or R3Async bridge
methods.

That assembly currently contains two conditional generators:

- `R3BridgeGenerator` for R3 `Observable<T>` boundaries and R3-to-Primitives.Async adapters.
- `R3AsyncBridgeGenerator` for R3Async `AsyncObservable<T>` boundaries.

The generator stamps the consuming assembly with an assembly metadata attribute:

```csharp
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyMetadata("ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator", "0.1.0")]
```

It does not generate a custom marker attribute type. This avoids duplicate generated type identities across
project-reference and `InternalsVisibleTo` builds, including the CS0436 warning path seen when two compilations both
generate the same internal marker type.

Bridge extension methods are emitted only when the consumer project already references the relevant external library
symbols:

- R3 bridge checks for `R3.Observable<T>`, `R3.Observer<T>`, and `R3.Result`.
- R3-to-Primitives.Async bridge checks for the same R3 symbols plus
  `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.IObservableAsync<T>`.
- R3Async bridge checks for `R3Async.AsyncObservable<T>`, `R3Async.AsyncObserver<T>`, `R3Async.Result`, and
  `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.IObservableAsync<T>`.

Generated bridge namespace:

- `ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge`

Generated R3 bridge methods:

- `AsPrimitivesSignal<T>(this R3.Observable<T> source)`
- `AsR3Observable<T>(this System.IObservable<T> source)`
- `AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable<T>(this R3.Observable<T> source)` when `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` is referenced
- `AsR3Observable<T>(this ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.IObservableAsync<T> source)` when `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` is
  referenced

Generated R3Async bridge methods:

- `AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable<T>(this R3Async.AsyncObservable<T> source)` when R3Async and
  `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` are referenced
- `AsR3AsyncObservable<T>(this ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.IObservableAsync<T> source)` when R3Async and
  `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` are referenced

R3 bridge example, when the consuming project references R3 and the generator package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator
dotnet add package R3
```

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Signals;

// R3.Observable<int> r3Source = ...;
IObservable<int> primitivesSource = r3Source.AsPrimitivesSignal();
R3.Observable<int> r3Again = Signal.Sequence(1, 3).AsR3Observable();
```

R3 async bridge example, when the consuming project references R3, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and the generator
package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator
dotnet add package R3
```

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge;

// R3.Observable<int> r3Source = ...;
IObservableAsync<int> primitivesAsync = r3Source.AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable();
R3.Observable<int> r3Again = primitivesAsync.AsR3Observable();
```

R3Async bridge example, when the consuming project references R3Async, `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async`, and the generator
package:

```bash
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async
dotnet add package ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator
dotnet add package R3Async
```

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge;

// R3Async.AsyncObservable<int> r3AsyncSource = ...;
IObservableAsync<int> primitivesAsync = r3AsyncSource.AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable();
R3Async.AsyncObservable<int> r3AsyncAgain = primitivesAsync.AsR3AsyncObservable();
```

The R3 snippets are intentionally shown as migration shapes because they require the consuming application to reference
R3 or R3Async and opt into `ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge.Generator`. ReactiveUI.Primitives itself remains free of R3
and R3Async runtime dependencies. System.Reactive interop lives in the `.Reactive` package variants, which recompile the
same Primitives APIs against System.Reactive `Unit` and `IScheduler`.

## System.Reactive to ReactiveUI.Primitives migration guide

ReactiveUI.Primitives is not a byte-for-byte clone of System.Reactive. It keeps the standard `IObservable<T>` contracts
but favors a smaller runtime, explicit state types, and Primitives naming. Migrate one vertical slice at a time:
factories first, then subject/state types, then operators and schedulers.

When a project must keep System.Reactive `Unit` or `IScheduler` in its public surface, use
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive` or `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive`. The former
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions.Reactive` helpers are included in `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive`. When the goal is
to migrate away from those public System.Reactive types, use the lean packages and the mappings below.

### Migration track: existing `xyz` project

Use this track when the project should eventually stop exposing System.Reactive types and use the lean
ReactiveUI.Primitives package family.

1. Inventory references and public API. Mark each project that exposes `System.Reactive.Unit`, `IScheduler`,
   `IObservable<T>` extension methods, UI schedulers, `Subject<T>` types, or ReactiveUI.Extensions helpers.
2. Add the lean packages needed by the existing project:

```bash
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async
```

3. Add only the matching UI integration package when the project owns UI-thread dispatch:

```bash
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Wpf
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinForms
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia
dotnet add xyz/xyz.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui
```

4. Convert boundary types deliberately: `System.Reactive.Unit` to `RxVoid`, `IScheduler` to `ISequencer`, Rx subjects to
   `Signal<T>`, `StateSignal<T>`, `ReplaySignal<T>`, or `FinalSignal<T>`, and composite disposable types to
   `MultipleDisposable`, `Pocket`, `Slot`, or `AssignmentSlot`.
5. Keep code compiling during the first pass by using the Rx-name compatibility layer (`Select`, `Where`, `Aggregate`,
   `Scan`, `Merge`, `Concat`, `CombineLatest`, `SelectMany`, and related aliases). Then move hot paths to Primitives
   names (`Map`, `Keep`, `Reduce`, `Fold`, `Blend`, `Chain`, `SyncLatest`, `FlatMap`) where that makes the code clearer.
6. Replace scheduler construction and tests: use `Sequencer.Immediate`, `Sequencer.CurrentThread`,
   `ThreadPoolSequencer.Instance`, `TaskPoolSequencer.Instance`, UI sequencers, and `VirtualClock`.
7. Remove `System.Reactive` and `ReactiveUI.Extensions` package references only after the project builds without
   `System.Reactive.Linq`, `System.Reactive.Subjects`, `System.Reactive.Disposables`, or
   `System.Reactive.Concurrency` imports.
8. Run tests and package/API approval checks. For time-sensitive tests, use virtual time rather than real sleeps.

### Migration track: new `xyz.Reactive` project

Use this track when an existing Rx-based source base must remain source-compatible for consumers while the repository
moves implementation work onto ReactiveUI.Primitives. The pattern is to keep or create a `xyz` lean package and add a
new `xyz.Reactive` package that references the `.Reactive` Primitives range.

1. Move shared implementation files into a shared source folder that can be linked by both projects.
2. In shared source, use the neutral identifiers `RxVoid` and `ISequencer`. In the lean project they bind to
   ReactiveUI.Primitives types; in the `.Reactive` project they bind to `System.Reactive.Unit` and
   `System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler`.
3. Gate namespaces when the public namespace must differ:

```csharp
#if REACTIVE_SHIM
namespace xyz.Reactive;
#else
namespace xyz;
#endif
```

4. Reference the `.Reactive` packages from `xyz.Reactive`:

```bash
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive
```

5. Add the matching reactive UI package only when the project exposes UI scheduling:

```bash
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Wpf.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinForms.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.WinUI.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Blazor.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Avalonia.Reactive
dotnet add xyz.Reactive/xyz.Reactive.csproj package ReactiveUI.Primitives.Maui.Reactive
```

6. Configure the reactive project to define `REACTIVE_SHIM` and alias the System.Reactive types if your repository does
   not already centralize this in `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);REACTIVE_SHIM</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
  <Using Include="System.Reactive.Unit" Alias="RxVoid" />
  <Using Include="System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler" Alias="ISequencer" />
</ItemGroup>
```

7. Prefer zero source changes in the first `xyz.Reactive` pass: keep Rx names such as `Select`, `Where`, `SelectMany`,
   `CombineLatest`, `Merge`, `Concat`, `Throttle`, and `WithLatestFrom` where compatibility matters. The `.Reactive`
   Primitives packages supply those names over the Primitives implementation.
8. Build both packages side by side. `xyz` should have no System.Reactive runtime dependency; `xyz.Reactive` should keep
   System.Reactive-facing APIs for existing consumers.

### Testing migration

System.Reactive test code commonly uses `TestScheduler` and marble helpers. ReactiveUI.Primitives currently exposes
virtual-time primitives rather than cloning the full Rx testing API. Prefer repository-native tests that:

- Use `VirtualClock` for deterministic scheduling.
- Assert values collected through `Subscribe` delegates.
- Dispose subscriptions explicitly.
- Use `CollectArrayAsync`, `CollectListAsync`, or `FirstAsync` when a task-shaped assertion is clearer.

## R3Async to ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async migration guide

`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` is the native async-observable package. Use it when observer work is asynchronous,
subscription/disposal needs `ValueTask`, or cancellation must flow through each notification. It differs from R3Async by
using
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Result` for completion.

There is no generated System.Reactive.Async bridge in the current package set. Use
`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async.Reactive` when you need async Primitives APIs compiled against System.Reactive `Unit` and
`IScheduler`, and keep any other async-observable adapter code at package or API edges.

| R3Async                            | ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async                      | Migration detail                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `R3Async.AsyncObservable<T>`       | `IObservableAsync<T>` / `SignalAsync<T>`         | Use generated `AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable()` at external boundaries.                                |
| `R3Async.AsyncObserver<T>`         | `IObserverAsync<T>` / `WitnessAsync<T>`          | Use `WitnessAsync<T>` for custom observers that need disposal, cancellation, and concurrency checks. |
| `R3Async.Result`                   | `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Result`                   | Both carry success/failure; bridge adapters convert between them.                                    |
| `OnErrorResumeAsync`               | `OnErrorResumeAsync`                             | Same error-resume concept; Primitives passes the active `CancellationToken`.                         |
| `OnCompletedAsync(R3Async.Result)` | `OnCompletedAsync(ReactiveUI.Primitives.Result)` | Completion remains result-based.                                                                     |

R3Async bridge example:

```csharp
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async;
using ReactiveUI.Primitives.R3Bridge;

// R3Async.AsyncObservable<int> r3AsyncSource = ...;
IObservableAsync<int> native = r3AsyncSource.AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable();
R3Async.AsyncObservable<int> external = native.AsR3AsyncObservable();
```

Keep R3Async bridge conversions at package or API edges. Inside the application or library, prefer `SignalAsync`
factories, `IObservableAsync<T>` operators, and `IObserverAsync<T>` observers directly.

## R3 migration notes

R3 uses its own `Observable<T>` type and observer model. ReactiveUI.Primitives stays on the BCL `IObservable<T>` shape
for runtime interoperability.

| R3 concept            | ReactiveUI.Primitives equivalent                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `R3.Observable<T>`    | BCL `IObservable<T>` from ReactiveUI.Primitives factories/operators.                                                                                                                                   |
| R3 subject            | `Signal<T>` / `StateSignal<T>` / `ReplaySignal<T>` depending on state/replay needs.                                                                                                                    |
| R3 `Select` / `Where` | `Map` / `Keep`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| R3 time operators     | `Signal.After`, `Signal.Pulse`, `Calm`, `Probe`, `Shift`, scheduler overloads.                                                                                                                         |
| R3 bridge             | Generated `AsPrimitivesSignal` / `AsR3Observable`; async bridge methods add `AsPrimitivesAsyncObservable` / `AsR3Observable` when R3 and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` are referenced by the consumer. |

Use the generated bridge only at boundaries. Prefer native ReactiveUI.Primitives operators inside new code.

## ReactiveUI.Extensions migration notes

`ReactiveUI.Primitives` is the migration target for the non-async helpers that previously lived in
`ReactiveUI.Extensions`. The helpers remain in the `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions` namespace and intentionally keep
their names where those names already describe the behavior and do not collide with the core Primitives vocabulary.
Scheduling overloads use `ISequencer` instead of System.Reactive schedulers.

| ReactiveUI.Extensions usage                                                             | ReactiveUI.Primitives usage                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WhereIsNotNull`, `SkipWhileNull`, `WhereTrue`, `WhereFalse`, `Not`                     | Same names over BCL `IObservable<T>`.                                                        |
| `WhereSelect`, `SelectConstant`, `TrySelect`, `SelectManyThen`, `Pairwise`, `Partition` | Same helper names; implemented with direct observers and fused operator shapes where useful. |
| `SyncTimer`, `ObserveOnIf`, `Schedule`, `ScheduleSafe`, throttle/debounce helpers       | Same helper names; use `ISequencer` overloads for scheduling.                                |
| `CatchIgnore`, `CatchAndReturn`, `CatchReturn`, retry helpers                           | Same helper names; no System.Reactive dependency.                                            |
| `SubscribeAsync`, `SelectAsync`, `SelectLatestAsync`, `DropIfBusy`                      | Same BCL observable helper names for Task/ValueTask interop.                                 |
| `RunAll`, `BufferUntil`, `FirstMatchFromCandidates`, `ToHotTask`, `ToHotValueTask`      | Same helper names; backed by ReactiveUI.Primitives runtime utilities.                        |

For async-native streams, prefer `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` and its `IObservableAsync<T>` operators. For existing BCL
observable helpers, migrate to `ReactiveUI.Primitives`; existing `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Extensions` imports remain valid.

## Benchmarks and performance posture

Benchmarks live in `src/benchmarks/ReactiveUI.Primitives.Benchmarks`. The benchmark project may reference
System.Reactive, System.Reactive.Async 6.0.0-alpha.18, R3, and ReactiveUI.Extensions to compare throughput and
allocation behavior; the production packages must not.

The latest complete BenchmarkDotNet run finished on 2026-06-08 at 19:39:12 Europe/London with .NET SDK
11.0.100-preview.4.26230.115 and .NET runtime 10.0.8 on Windows 11. It executed 617 benchmarks with no failed benchmark
process in 01:16:58:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/benchmarks/ReactiveUI.Primitives.Benchmarks/ReactiveUI.Primitives.Benchmarks.csproj --framework net10.0 --configuration Release --no-restore -- --filter "*" --join --launchCount 1 --warmupCount 1 --iterationCount 3
```

Latest artifact paths:

- `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/BenchmarkRun-joined-2026-06-08-19-39-12-report.csv`

The joined run exports 617 raw BenchmarkDotNet rows: 238 ReactiveUI.Primitives or ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async cases, 157
System.Reactive cases, 132 R3 cases, and 90 ReactiveUI.Extensions cases. The current table includes the async
replay-latest subscription scenario and subject multicast fan-out scenarios that were not present in the previous
610-row run.

The table below groups `ReactiveUI.Primitives` and `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Async` into the `ReactiveUI.Primitives`
column, aligns each primitive benchmark with any System.Reactive, R3, or ReactiveUI.Extensions alternative from the same
benchmark scenario, and uses `NA` where no alternative exists. It contains 238 alphabetically ordered scenario rows.
Cells use `Mean / Allocated`, and long `scenario` parameter values from BenchmarkDotNet are restored to their full
names.

External-baseline posture from this run: ReactiveUI.Primitives is faster than System.Reactive in 151/157 measured
comparisons, faster than R3 in 131/132 measured comparisons, and faster than ReactiveUI.Extensions 4.0.0 in 58/90
measured comparisons. Rows that are not faster remain listed for direct comparison.

BenchmarkDotNet emitted `ZeroMeasurement` warnings for several singleton or empty-method-scale paths, including
`Return`, `CompletedSpark`, `Never`-style subscriptions, and `SubscribeAndComplete`. Those warnings mean the measured
duration is indistinguishable from empty method overhead; the benchmark run still completed and exported all 617 rows.

## Practical migration checklist

1. Replace subject construction with `Signal<T>`, `StateSignal<T>`, or `ReplaySignal<T>` depending on current behavior.
2. Replace factories: `Observable.Return/Empty/Throw/Timer/Interval` to `Signal.Emit/None/Fail/After/Pulse`.
3. Replace hot-path operators with Primitives names: `Select -> Map`, `Where -> Keep`, `SelectMany -> FlatMap`,
   `Do -> Tap`, `Scan -> Fold`, `Aggregate -> Reduce`, `Amb -> Race`.
4. Replace composite/serial disposables with `MultipleDisposable`/`Pocket` and `SingleReplaceableDisposable`/`Slot`.
5. Keep System.Reactive, R3, or R3Async at application boundaries only when required; use `.Reactive` package variants
   for System.Reactive public-surface compatibility and generated bridge methods for R3/R3Async boundaries.
6. Run build, tests, pack, and `git diff --check` before publishing or merging.
